# hajj_umrah_crowd_management
This dataset is designed to support research and development in AI and Augmented Reality (AR)-based systems for managing crowds during the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The dataset captures a range of factors influencing crowd behavior, individual pilgrim activity, environmental conditions, health data, security incidents, and interactions with technology such as AR systems.

It contains 10,000 records of simulated data from a variety of pilgrims participating in religious activities, movement patterns, and crowd dynamics, with a focus on both physical and technological aspects. This dataset can be used to train machine learning models for crowd prediction, safety management, and personalized guidance for pilgrims using AR technologies.
